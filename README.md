# technical-test
A basic level technical test for applicants for a QA position

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The technical test has one goal and one rule:

THE GOAL:
- Make all the unit tests in the 'TechnicalTestUnitTests' project pass

THE RULE:
- Achieve the goal by ONLY modifying (the code in) the 'TechnicalTestCore' project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE BEAR IN MIND:
- We are aware that the technical skill of QA professionals varies greatly. The 
test will be trivial for some and hard for others. As such not being able to
complete the entire test doesn't mean your application won't be considered. We'd
just like to see how far you did get.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNICAL INFO:
- Programming language: C#
- Unit testing framework: xUnit
- Non-standard C# library used: FluentAssertions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO GET THE TECHNICAL TEST ON YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM:
1. Either clone (but do **NOT** fork) using Git
     1. Install Git to your local system
     2. Go to https://github.com and sign in (create an account if you don't have one)
     3. Go to https://github.com/dynamiccredit-qa/basic-technical-test
     4. Click on the green-colored 'Clone or Download' button
     5. Use the provided .git URL to clone the repository to your local system with the installed Git client (again: do **NOT** fork)
2. Or download
     1. Go to https://github.com/dynamiccredit-qa/basic-technical-test
     2. Click on the green-colored 'Clone or Download' button
     3. Click on the 'Download ZIP' button to download a copy of the solution

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE TECHNICAL TEST
1. Install Visual Studio to your local system
2. Open the TechnicalTest.sln file with Visual Studio
3. Rightclick on the solution in the Solution Explorer and choose 'Restore Nuget
   Packages'
4. Choose 'Build | Build solution'
5. Open UnitTests.cs in the TechnicalTestUnitTests project
6. Rightclick in the opened UnitTests.cs window and click 'Run Tests'
7. If all went well this will make the unit tests run. The technical test consists
   of making these (failing) unit tests pass.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HANDING IN THE TEST RESULTS:
There are two ways to hand in the exercise:
1. Either commit your solution to a GitHub repository of your own (preferred):
     1. Commit your solution to the test to your local Git repository
     2. Push your commit upstream to your GitHub repository
     3. Send an email with a link to the branch of your GitHub fork containing your 
       work to your contact at the office
2. Or make a .zip or .7z of your solution and email it to your contact at the 
   office
